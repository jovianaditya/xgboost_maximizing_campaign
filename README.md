# Maximizing Term Deposit Campaign With XGBoost Modelling

In this project there are still very few bank customers who open term deposits (from 45,211 customers, only about 11% open term deposits). The model created can classify bank customers who are interested in opening term deposits and those who are not interested. From a simple simulation that was made, the XGBoost model can increase the conversion rate by up to 6% and can also reduce phone costs by up to 68%.
